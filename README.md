<h1> Hack the Bronx 2 Submission </h1>

<h1> Inspiration </h1>
There is an alarming rate of 38% Bronx residents without any access to broadband internet despite being part of New York City. Bronx residents have feedback on relatively slow internet speeds in their neighbourhood. During COVID19, this issue was magnified when all physical interactions were shifted online. Bronx residents struggled to adapt digitally with insufficient digital skills and access to technological devices to gain access to basic needs during quarantine. Thus, governments and non-profit organisations intervened to provide necessary digital devices and broadband access for Bronx residents. Through this hackathon, I am inspired to make a difference by creating solutions to upskill the digital literacy of Bronx community through digital inclusion.

<h1> What it does </h1>
DigiCares comprises of DigiTruck operating onsite and DigiCreate targeting online users. DigiTrucks aims to combat the problem behind the lack of physical access and ownership of digital devices. Through these trucks, Bronx residents can enjoy complimentary usage to digital devices and gain awareness of subsidies for for digital devices. It can serve to educate residents on the importance of digital literacy wtih complimentary onsite workshops as a complement. DigiCreate would be an online initiative to further upskill teens to learn coding which can potentially help them secure a job. It provides free coding courses through partnerships with non-profit organisations. Also, the workshops details and location of DigiTrucks would be updated on this website.

<h1> How we built it </h1>
The website was built using HTML and CSS facilitating as a complement to the onsite solution of having DigiTrucks.

<h1> Challenges we ran into </h1>
The creation of a website in a short span of one week along with brainstorming on feasible solutions proved to be quite challenging.

<h1> Accomplishments that we're proud of </h1>
I am glad to have conceptualised and completed my first digital website and presentation for my first hackathon.

<h1> What we learned </h1>
The challenges faced by Bronx community can be made prominent through fundraising sites to gather more funds for the purchase of digital devices and infrastructure for every household. Digital literacy skills and education are an important enabler to improve our quality of life.

<h1> What's next for DigiCares </h1>
DigiTrucks can be implemented in the Bronx community along with forming partnerships with non-profit organisations teaching teens to code such as Hour of Code. Volunteers would be required as trainers to guide Bronx residents through their digital journey.
